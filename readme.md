# r/place 2017 canva reconstructor

I found the 2017's r/place tile placement's history dataset on Kaggle, you can download it from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/residentmario/reddit-rplace-history) - it is required to be downloaded and placed on this directory for this code to work!

And enjoy!
